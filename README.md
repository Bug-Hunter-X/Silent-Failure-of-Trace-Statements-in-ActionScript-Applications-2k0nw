# Silent Failure of Trace Statements in ActionScript Applications

This repository demonstrates a common, yet often overlooked, issue in ActionScript development: the silent failure of `trace()` statements in compiled applications.  `trace()` is a valuable debugging tool within the Flash IDE, but it's crucial to understand its limitations when deploying to a production environment.

## The Problem

ActionScript's `trace()` function sends output to the Flash Player's output panel.  If your application runs outside this environment (e.g., a stand-alone AIR application or when embedded in another application), the `trace()` calls will produce no visible output.  This can lead to subtle bugs that are difficult to identify because there is no visual indication of errors.

## The Solution

For robust error handling and debugging in deployed applications, consider using alternative logging methods such as writing to a file, using a dedicated logging library, or integrating with a remote logging service.  These methods offer more reliable and persistent logging than `trace()`, providing valuable information for troubleshooting issues in a production environment.

## Example Code

The `bug.as` file shows the problematic code with trace statements. The `bugSolution.as` file demonstrates a better approach using a custom logging function.
