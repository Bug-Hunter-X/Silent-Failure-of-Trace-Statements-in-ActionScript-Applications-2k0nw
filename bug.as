```actionscript
function someFunction():void {
  // Some code here
  trace("This is a trace statement");
  // More code here
}
```
This code has a potential problem:  The `trace()` statement relies on the Flash Player's output panel or a similar debugging environment. If the code runs outside this environment (e.g., a compiled application), this statement will have no visible effect, and any debugging information will be lost.  The program will execute silently, making debugging difficult.

In more complex scenarios, this can lead to a situation where a function, class, or method appears to work correctly when tested in the Flash IDE, but fails silently when running in a stand-alone application or embedded in another environment.
